    <h1>Networks and Protocols</h1>
    <h2>Foreword</h2>
    <p>This has nothing to do with the course given at the APU. I just
    thought that there was a need for a more structured lesson about networks
    and protocols.</p>

    <h2>What is a network ?</h2>
    <p>A network is a bunch of things that are exchanging other things. Yeah,
  this definition seems useless, but it's actually the most precise. Every
  time there is an exchange there is a network. For example we could consider
  the network of cities in Germany as people and merchandises travel from one
  to the other. But you are futur computer scientist so let's have a look at
  information networks (where the thing exchanged is information).</p>

  <p>One of the oldest information network is the network of alert fires
  build by the romans (and the chineses yes...). It was a really simple
  network with only 1 bit of information : fire means attack, no fire means
  no attack.</p>

  the lord of the ring...">

  <p>There are two possible actions with the elements of this network: light
  a fire or not. The convention that links the action to a meaning (attack or
  not) as well as the procedure to observe to use the network (when I see a
  fire or an attack, I light my fire) is called a protocol.</p>

  <em id="important">A protocol is just a convention to know what to do and
    understand what we see.</em>
