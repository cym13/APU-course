    <h1>Entrepreneurship and Negotiation</h1>
    <h2>What is an entrepreneur ?</h2>
    <p>
    Entrepreneurship seeks to understand how opportunities to create
    something new arise and are discovered or created by specific persons who
    then use various mears to exploit or develop them, thus producing a wide
    range of effects.
    </p>
    <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identifying an opportunity</li>
        <li>Exploiting or developing this opportunity</li>
        <li>Runnig a new business successfully</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>Process of entrepreneurship:</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognition of an opportunity</li>
        <li>Deciding to proceed and assembling resources</li>
        <li>Launching a new venture</li>
        <li>Building success</li>
        <li>Hurvesting the rewards</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Summary of key points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As a field of busines seeks to understand how opportunities arise
      and how individuals develop them into procucing a wide range of
      effects.</li>
      <li>In recent years, the allure has increased so much that more people
      are choosing it as a career.</li>
      <li>As a branch of business has roots in many other discriplines -
      economics, sociology, behavioural science.</li>
      <li>Is a process.</li>
      <li>Happens when there is a «collision» at the crossroads of valuable
      opportunities and enterprising individuals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Uncovering Opportunities</h2>
    <h3>Generalities</h3>
    <p>
    Example: Tony Fernandez, boughter of AirAsia saw that Malaysian people
    could'nt fly as it was too expensive. He decreased the cost by making the
    on-fly meal non-free. He bought that company for 1RM as it was in a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
    Not all opportunities are equals. Some are more favorable. For exemple,
    an opportunity that needs a lot of money to initalise may not be adapted
    for a new company with limited budget. Opportunities exists because
    people do not have the same informations.
    </p>
    <p>
    Improving a life-style, being innovative, trying new way of doing
    things is a key to entrepreneurship.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes</h3>
    <p>
    Deregulations can open a new market as well as regulations introducing
    new constraints. Being the first one to adapt to this regulation can be
    very profitable. Some regulations and political decisions can help new
    companies and thus make it easier to try catching opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
    Social and demographic changes are important as well as it alters demand
    for products and services. For exemple an aging population will open
    opportunities in a lot of facilities targetting older poeple.
    </p>
    <h3>New vs Established firms</h3>
    <p>
    New firms are usually the ones that introduce new products and
    services, and established firms are usually the ones that introduce new
    production processes.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is way more easy to copy a product or a service than a production
    process.
    </p>
    <p>
    New firms do better in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Industries that have greater R&amp;D intensity</li>
      <li>Industrise in which public sector organisations produce most of the
      technology</li>
      <li>Industries in which small firms are the better innovators</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Larger markets</li>
      <li>Rapidly growing markets</li>
      <li>More heavily segmented markets</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>When Industries are young</li>
      <li>Before a dominant design emerges</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Competence destroying change</li>
      <li>Discrete products and services</li>
      <li>Ideas embedded in human capital</li>
    </ul>
    <p>New firms performs more poorly in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Capital-intensive industries</li>
      <li>Advertising-intensive industries</li>
      <li>Concentrated industries</li>
      <li>Industries composed of mostly large firms</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Advantages of Established firms </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The learning curve</li>
      <li>Established reputation</li>
      <li>Positive cash flow</li>
      <li>Economies of scale</li>
      <li>Complementary assets</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Opportunity Recognition</h2>

    <b>CRISIS:</b> In mandarin, the symbol for "crisis" is composed of
    "danger" and "opportunity".

    <h3>Why are some successfull ?</h3>

    </ol>
    <p>
    Ideas occur when individuals use existing knowledge they have gained (and
    retained) to make a problem emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
    Unique experience ⇾ Knowledge ⇾ Idea generation
    </p>

    <h2>Money</h2>

    <h3>How much do you need?</h3>

    <p>
    More money isn't necessarily better. One may feel more pressure for it
    or decide to change your plans because you think that you can do more and
    fail at making it evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
    Investors must make judgments based on little actual evidence and may
    disagree on value of new venture. They want a garanty.
    </p>
    <p>
    This garanty can be a collateral or an equity (percentage of the company).
